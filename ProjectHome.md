This project is targeting the remote connection between multiple mobile multitouch devices. Two or more devices are to expand the view of an application on the screens of all partaking devices. (In contrast just to clone the view.)
The idea is to extend the RemoteFrameBuffer-Protocol.
Furthermore a multitouch-functionality will be added to the protocol.
In the first approach, the RFB-Protocol itself will not be changed. Though on pure multitouch devices (without a hardware-keyboard) the text-transmission from RFB will hardly be used, the text-transmission will be used to transfer multitouch user inputs.
